<h1>ABOUT HTML ENTITES</h1>


<div> <h3>Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.</h3></div>
 
 <div >Some Characters are reserved in HTML.</div>

<p>If we use the less than(<)or greater than (>) signs in our text, then  the browser  might mix them with tags.</p>
<div > A character entity looks like this:</div>
 <div ><center>  &entity name;</div>
 <div> <center>OR</div>
<div><center> &#entity_number;</div>
  



<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<p> this is paragraph</p>
A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.

Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.

<div>Examples:</div>
<div>html</div>
<div>10pm</div>


<li><p>this  is another&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paragrph  with spaces</p></li>
<strong>&amp;</strong>nbsp;means non breaking space
<p>If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the <strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong>character entity.</p>


<li><p> paragrph  is written like this &lt;p&gt;</p></li>
using &lt; &gt; we can prints the tags  which we want, see the example above
<li><p>copyright  is written like  this  &copy;</p>
</li>
<li><p>pound is writtrn like this  &pound;</p></li>
<li><p> this is another  &rAarr;</p></li>
<li><p>this is another  &frac14;</p></li>
<li><p>empty character written like  this &#8203;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>  there are manay entities we can use according to our needs</p>
